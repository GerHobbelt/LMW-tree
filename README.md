vmtree: vectorial m-way tree
============================

This package combines several algorithms that use the m-way nearest neighbor
tree structre to store their data.

The algorithms are primarily focussed of comptutationally efficient clustering.
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning process that finds interesting
patterns it data. It places similar items into clusters and dissimilar items
into different clusters.

The package includes EM-tree, K-tree, k-means, TSVQ, repeated k-means,
clustering, random projections, random indexing, hashing, bit signatures.

vmtree is licensed under the BSD license.
